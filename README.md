🔍 **Project Overview**

The dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of user listening behavior over time. It tracks KPIs such as:

Total Albums Played, Artists Played, and Tracks Played

Year-over-Year (YOY) comparisons to identify growth or decline in engagement

Top 5 Albums, Artists, and Tracks to highlight most popular content

Listening trends across devices (Android, iOS, Web, Desktop, etc.)

Weekday vs Weekend patterns for deeper behavioral insights

The design ensures users can interact with the dashboard using filters, slicers, and drill-throughs for more personalized exploration.

🛠️ **Tools & Techniques**

Power BI Desktop – Data modeling, report building, and dashboard creation

Power Query (M Language) – Data cleaning, transformations, and shaping

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Custom measures and KPIs for calculations like YOY Growth, YTD metrics, and dynamic filtering

Data Modeling (Star Schema) – Optimized relationships between fact and dimension tables for better performance

🚀 **Key Features**

📊 KPI cards for quick snapshot of Albums, Artists, and Tracks played

📈 Line and bar charts to show listening trends over time

🎶 Top 5 rankings to easily identify favorite albums, artists, and songs

🔄 Year-over-Year comparison visuals with percentage growth/decline

📱 Device-based usage insights to track engagement patterns across platforms

⏳ Optimized performance with query folding, incremental refresh, and measures instead of calculated columns
